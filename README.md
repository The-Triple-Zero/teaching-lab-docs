# Teaching Lab Documentation

This repository is intended to be used in conjunction to the [Teaching Lab](https://github.com/stew3254/teaching-lab). This repository
will provide documentation for the various aspects of the teaching lab, and may contain useful scripts to make certain actions easier. For example, setting up RustDesk for a better remote-desktop experience.

All documentation files are intended to be viewable as plain-text, and rendered into HTML.
