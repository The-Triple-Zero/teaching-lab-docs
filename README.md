# Teaching Lab Documentation

This repository is intended to be used in conjunction to the [Teaching Lab](https://github.com/stew3254/teaching-lab). It is intended to provide documentation for the various aspects of the teaching lab and some very basic primers on Linux concepts. In addition, it may contain useful scripts to make certain actions easier. For example, setting up RustDesk for a better remote-desktop experience.

All documentation files are intended to be viewable as plain-text, and rendered into HTML. Therefore, images will be avoided, and verbal descriptions are preferred so that these are entirely consumable in a command-line environment.

# How can I update these documents?

As long as you haven't manually edited any files to this repository, you can update them locally using the following command:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

In addition, you can view these documents in your web browser at the [Teaching Lab Documents](https://github.com/stew3254/teaching-lab-docs).

# Additional resources

If you're looking to learn more about Linux, the following resources are great guides to get the exposure to all of the basic concepts. The first two are surface-level material which will give you an introduction, whereas *The LInux Command Line* book is much more in-depth.
